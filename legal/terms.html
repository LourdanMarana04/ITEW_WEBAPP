            <p class="text-muted">Last Updated: April 30, 2025</p>

            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Wansekonds Entertainment website (the "Service") operated by Wansekonds Entertainment ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

            <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Wansekonds Entertainment and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Wansekonds Entertainment.</p>

            <h2>2. Use License</h2>
            <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Wansekonds Entertainment' website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Wansekonds Entertainment' website;</li>
                <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Wansekonds Entertainment at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

            <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The materials on Wansekonds Entertainment' website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Wansekonds Entertainment makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
            <p>Further, Wansekonds Entertainment does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.</p>

            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>In no event shall Wansekonds Entertainment or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Wansekonds Entertainment' website, even if Wansekonds Entertainment or a Wansekonds Entertainment authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

            <h2>5. Accuracy of Materials</h2>
            <p>The materials appearing on Wansekonds Entertainment' website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Wansekonds Entertainment.</p>
            <p>Wansekonds Entertainment has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Wansekonds Entertainment shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third-party web sites or services.</p>

            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

            <h2>8. Changes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
